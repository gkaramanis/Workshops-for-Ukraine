# Workshops for Ukraine - Getting creative with ggplot2

[Presentation and exercises](https://gkaramanis.github.io/Workshops-for-Ukraine/#/getting-creative-with-ggplot2)  
[Exercises only](https://gkaramanis.github.io/Workshops-for-Ukraine/exercises.html#/exercises---part-1)


For the exercises, we'll be using webR, which will allow us to run R code in the browser, no need to install anything.

Use ```Presentation and exercises```, if you want to follow along during the presentation, or ```Exercises only``` if you only want to see the slides containing exercises. 

If your prefer to run the exercises in your installation of RStudio or Positron, you can copy the code from the exercises. In that case, make sure to have the following packages installed: ggplot2, dplyr, ggridges, MetBrewer and treemapify.
  
  
<pre>install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "ggridges", "MetBrewer", "treemapify")) </pre>


After installation, you can load the packages in your R session:

<pre>
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(ggridges)
library(MetBrewer)
library(treemapify)
</pre>
