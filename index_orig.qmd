## Getting creative with ggplot2

::: notes
I guess most of you know that can you create great data visualizations with R and ggplot2 But did you know that you can also create visualizations like

or those
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why?

Creative visualizations stand out

Emotional connection, engagement

Better and more clear communication

::: notes
My talk is about creative visualizations but you may ask, why?

making the plot more resonant and memorable, retain information better
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why?

Self-expression

::: notes
My feeling is that when most people talk about creativity what they actually mean is having a personal style
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Creativity

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

Novelty

Useful solutions

Transform or synthesize

Connecting seemingly unrelated concepts

## Agenda

Finding inspiration

Getting creative with code

Making it personal

::: notes
We'll look at some tips, how we can make the process easier, all the way from the start to the end, and we're breaking it down to 3 parts
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Finding inspiration

![](assets/img/chapter1.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Finding inspiration

Look at other people's work

Dissect their choices

Imitate style or techniques

Remix

::: notes
The most obvious

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Finding inspiration

Sketch

![](assets/img/sketch.png)

::: notes
Analog/Digital Spend 5-10 minutes to sketch out some ideas I get "locked" when I code
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Finding inspiration

Break the rules

![](assets/img/names.png)

::: notes
Deliberately try to break the rules

I did it a lot in the beginning but not intentionally, I didn't know the rules
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Finding inspiration

Try data art 

![](assets/img/dataart.png)

::: notes
Try data art to get ideas or find new ways to visualize data That's how I found truchet R package, and I made bars with it
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Finding inspiration

Ask an LLM

![](assets/img/chatgpt.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Exercises

Find visualizations of other people, dissect

First level: why you like it

Second level: how they made it

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Try

```{webr-r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, y = cut, fill = cut)) + 
  geom_density_ridges() 
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

search in other fields

[CRAN Task Views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/){target="_blank"}

![](assets/img/cran-views.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

break the rules (give examples, or ask to create a "bad" chart)

::: notes
Common in the R community to share your code If you see something you like, look at the code
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Finding creative inspiration

Recreate data visualizations made with other tools

::: notes
Similar to remixing, but this is more of an exercise, you have a goal and you have to come up with solutions

My favorite thing to do, great way to learn!!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## getting creative with code

Try out different options in ggplot2 functions

Try to break things

::: notes
Get to know your tool

Try options and see how it affects your plot Try extreme values, very thick lines, huge or tiny text, play with transparency, negative values

(That's how I found out about negative margins)
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## getting creative with code

![](assets/img/penguins.png)

::: notes
Use geoms beyond their intended use (off-label!)

Try to see geoms not as chart but as building blocks or drawing tools. geom_point is not for scatterplots, it's for drawing points
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## getting creative with code

![](assets/img/xray.png)

::: notes
I don't really know what the intended use for geom_bspline_closed() is, but I don't think it's for drawing penguins! :)
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## getting creative with code

Use geom_text()

![](assets/img/text.png)

::: notes
geom_text usually for labels, use it for mapping variables: you acn play with font size, color, fonts

I like text visualizations and I think they're underused

geom_text with ggfx blend
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## getting creative with code

Create your own geoms

![](assets/img/spirals.png)

::: notes
If you want something more custom, you can code it. I've tried but never really succeeded, maybe you'll have better luck
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## getting creative with code

Use ~~ggplot_build()~~ layer_data()

Make a plot with ggbeeswarm, use ggplot_build() to get the plot elements as data frame, then use it to plot the album with ggimage
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## getting creative with code

Participate in challenges:

Experiment

Learn

Get

feedback

::: notes
Share online if you want to, low risk environment, R people are usually nice :)

All my plots in this talk are from TidyTuesday submissions
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Exercises

copy and paste page from GitHub

------------------------------------------------------------------------

recreate a simple visualization made with another tool

------------------------------------------------------------------------

try to break ggplot (provide example)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{webr-r}
ggplot(economics, aes(date, unemploy)) + 
  geom_line()
```

Example

ggplot(economics, aes(date, unemploy, color = date)) + geom_line(size = 10, alpha = 0.5, lineend = "butt")

(Maybe this is get to know your tools)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

creative use of geom, ask to draw something

```{webr-r}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = c(-1, 1), y = 0), size = 50) +
  geom_curve(aes(x = -1, xend = 1, y = -1, yend = -1)) +
  coord_fixed(xlim = c(-2, 2), ylim = c(-2, 1))
```

Add nose, more eyes, pink cheeks, whatever

## Making it personal

![](assets/img/chapter3.png)

::: notes
We all are different, hard to give advice without sounding like "just be yourself". Which is not always a good advice. But there are a few things you can do
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Making it personal

Don't use the defaults (colors, fonts, etc.)

Remember accessibility!

![](assets/img/metbrewer.png)

::: notes
You can go a long way just by not using the defaults

Remember accessibility!
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Making it personal

When in doubt, subtract

Simplicity in design can be highly creative

![](assets/img/un.jpeg)

::: notes
Sometimes when we are creative, we tend to overcomplicate things

Instead subtract and go bold or not
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Making it personal

Try new techniques

Step out of comfort zones

::: notes
To find your own style, you have to actually try something new

If you feel a bit insecure, do a more conventional plot and a more creative one
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Making it personal

Choose subjects that resonate with you

Blend your interests, hobbies, knowledge

::: notes
Easier to be creative when you like the subject a TV show you like, gardening, whatever

Makes it easier to be personal
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 

Keep a list of ideas, packages, code snippets, etc.

Don't wait for inspiration

![](assets/img/inspiration.png)

::: notes
Make it easy for you Bookmarks, notebook, whatever works for you
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 

Always give credit!

![](assets/img/benice.png)

::: notes
Whenever you use something or get inspired by someone else on social media or maybe a comment in your code
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 

Just do it, creativity shouldn't be the goal

You can't be creative all the time

![](assets/img/cringe.jpeg)

::: notes
And to contradict myself here, try to be creative if you want to but...

I make not so creative plots most of time, sometimes even bad ones, like this disaster! :)

But it's okay
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 

Practice regularly

Make lots of visualizations

Share and get feedback

![](assets/img/nopressure.png)

::: notes
Creating your own style or expression is a skill and it takes time to develop
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Exercises

use own fonts and color palettes

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::::: columns
::: column
![](assets/img/mac-fontbook.png)
:::

::: column
![](assets/img/windows-fonts.webp)
:::
:::::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
```{webr-r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy, colour = class)) +
  geom_point()
```

Example: scale_color_met_d("Redon")
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy, colour = class)) +
  geom_point()
```
:::
:::::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

remove elements from plot, make it bolder
